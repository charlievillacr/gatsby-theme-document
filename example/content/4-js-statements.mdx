```js
var x, y, x;
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
```

## JavaScript Programs

A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called **statements**.

A **JavaScript program** is a list programming **statements**.

In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.

## JavaScript Statements

JavaScript statements are composed of:

- Values
- Operators
- Expressions
- Keywords
- & Comments. 

This statements tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":

```js
document.getElementById("demo".innerHTML)
```

Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.

The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.

JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code.

## Semicolons

Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.

Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:

```js
var a, b, c;    // Declare 3 variables
a = 5;          // Assign the value 5 to a 
b = 6;          // Assign the value 6 to b
c = a + b;      // Assign the sum of a and b to c
```

When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:

```js
a = 5: b = 6; c = a + b;
```

On the web, you might see examples without semicolons.

Ending statements with *semicolon* is not required, but **highly recommended.**

## JavaScript White Space

JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to you script to make it more readable:

```js
var person = "Hege";
var person="Hege";
```

A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * /)

```js
var x = y + z;

```

## JavaScript Line Lenght and Line Break

For best readability.programmers often like to avoid code lines linger than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statment does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

```js
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML+"Hello Dolly!";
```

## JavaScript Code Blocks

JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets `{...}`

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements gruped together in blocks, in JavaScript functions:

```js
function myFunction()
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML="Hello Dolly!";
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML="How are you?";
```

In this tutorial we use 2 spaces of indentation for code blocks. You will learn more about function later in this tutorial.

## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.

Visit our Reserved Words reference to view a full list of [JavaScript keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_reserved.asp)

### Keyword > Description

`break`         Terminates a switch or a loop

`continue`      Jumps out of a loop and starts ath the top

`debugger`      Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function

`do...while`    Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while condition is `true`.

`for`           Marks a block of statements to be xecuted, as long as condition is `true`.

`function`      Declares a function

`if...else`     Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition

`return`        Exits a function

`switch`        Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases

`try catch`     Implements error handling to ablock of statements

`var`           Declares a variable


JavaScript keywords are reserved words. Reserved words cannot de used as names for variables.
