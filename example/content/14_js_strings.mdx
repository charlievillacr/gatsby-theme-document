## JavaScript strings

Used for storing and manipulating text.

A string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

```js
var x = "John Doe";
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = "John Doe";  // String written inside quotes
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

You can use single or double quotes:

```js
var carName1 = "Volvo XC60";    // Double quotes
var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';    // Single quotes
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>Strings are written inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

var carName1 = "Volvo XC60"; // Double quotes
var carName2 = 'Volvo XC60'; // Single quotes

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
carName1 + " " + carName2; 

</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Result

JavaScript Strings

Strings are written inside quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

Volvo XC60 Volvo XC60


You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

```js
var answer1 = "It's alright";
var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var answer1 = "It's alright";
var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"'; 

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
answer1 + "<br>" + answer2 + "<br>" + answer3; 
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## String Length

To find the length of a string, use the built-in `length` property:

```js
var txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
var sln = txt.length;
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JS String Properties</h2>

<p>The lenght property returns the length of a string:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var txt = "ABCDFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=txt.length;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Escape Character

Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstan this string:

```js
var x = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
```

The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called".

The solution to avoid this problem, is to used the **backslash scape character**.

The backslash (`\`) escape character turns special characters intro string characters:

| **Code**      | **Result**    | **Description**       |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------------:|
| `\'`          | `'`           | Single quote          |
| `\"`          | `\\`          | Double quote          |
| `\\`          | `\`           | Backslash             |

The sequence `\"` insets a double quote in a string:

```js
var x = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>The escape sequence \" inserts a double quote in a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Result:

JavaScript Strings

The escape sequence \" inserts a double quote in a string.

We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.

The sequence `\'` inserts a single quote in a string:

```js
var x = 'It\'s alright.';
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>The escape sequence \' inserts a single quote in a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = 'It\'s alright.';
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

```js
var x = "The character \\ is called backslash.";
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>The escape sequence \\ inserts a backslash in a string.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = "The character \\ is called backslash.";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x; 
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Result

JavaScript Strings

The escape sequence `\\` inserts a backslash in a string.

The character \ is called backslash.


Six other escape sequences are valied in JavaScript:

| **Code**      | **Result**            |
|:-------------:|:---------------------:|
| `\b`          | Backspace             |   
| `\f`          | Form Feed             |
| `\n`          | New Line              |
| `\r`          | Carriage return       |
| `\t`          | Horizontal tabulator  |
| `\v`          | Vertical Tabulator    |

The 6 escape characters above were originally designed to control typewriters, teletypes, and fax machines. They do not make any sense in HTML.

## Breaking Long Code Lines

For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.

If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it is after an operator:

```js
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"Hello Dolly!";
```

A safer way to break up a string, is to use string addition:

```js

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello " + "Dolly!";
```

You cannot break up a code line with a backslash:

```js
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = \
"Hello Dolly!";
```

## Strings can be Objects

Normally, JavaScript strings are primitive values, created from literals:

`var firstName = "John";`

But strings can also be defined as objects with the keyword `new`:

`var firstName = new String("John");`

```js
var x = "John";
// > typeof x 'string'
var y = new String("John");
// > typeof y 'object'
```


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = "John";        // x is a string
var y = new String("John");  // y is an object

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
typeof x + "<br>" + typeof y;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Don't create strings as objects. It slows down execution speed.

The `new` keyword complicates the code. THi can produce some unexpected results:

```js
var x = "John";             
var y = new String("John");
// (x == y) is true because x and y have equal values 
```

When using the `===` operator, equal strings are not equal, because th `===` operator expects in both type and value.

```js
var x = "John";
var y = new String("John");
// (x === y) is false because x and y have different types (string and object)
```

Or even worse. Objects cannot be compared:

```js
var x = new String("John");
var y = new String("John");
// (x == y) is false because x and y are different objects
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>Never Create Strings as objects.</h2>

<p>JS objects cannot be compared.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

var x = new String("John");
var y = new String("John");
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML=(x==y);
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Note the difference between `(x==y)` and `(x===y)`.
Comparing two JavaScript objects will always return `false`.
