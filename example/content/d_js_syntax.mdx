## JS Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

```js
var x, y, z;    //How to declare variables
x = 5: y = 6;   //How to assign values
z = x + y;      //How to cmpute values
```

### JS Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: 

1. Fixed values: are called **literals**.
2. Variable values: are called **variables**

#### JavaScript Literals

The most important rules for writing **fixed values** are:

##### **Numbers**

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Number can be written with or without decimals.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 10.50;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

##### **Strings**
