## JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

Arithemetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).


Operator    Description
-----------------------------
1. `+`      Addition
2. `-`      Subtraction
3. `*`      Multiplication
4. `**`     Exponentiation
5. `/`      Division
6. `%`      Modulus
7. `++`     Increment
8. `--`     Decrement

## Arithmetic Operations

A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.

The two numbers can be literals:

```js
var x = 100 + 50:
```

or variables:

```js
var x = a + b;
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers (or variables) and produces a new number.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var a = 100;
var b = 50;
var x = a + b;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>

```

or expressions:

```js
var a = 3;
var x = (100 + 50) * a;
```

Result

```js
> var a = 3;
undefined
> var x = (100 + 50) * a;
undefined
> console.log(x)
450
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<body>

<p> A typical arithmetic operation takes two numbers (or expressions) and produces a new number.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var a = 3:
var x = (100 + 50) * a;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## Operators and Operands

The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called **operands**

The operation (to be performed beween the two operands) is defined by an **operator**.

- Operand > Operator  > Operand
- `100`   >  `+`      >  `50`

### Adding

The **adding** operator (`+`) andd numbers:

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x + y;
> console.log(z)
7
```

### Subtracting

The **subtraction** operator (`-`) subtracts numbers.

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x - y;
> console.log(z)
3
```

### Dividing

The **division** operator (`/`) divides numbers.

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x / y;
> console.log(z)
2.5
```

### Remainder

The **modulus** operator (`%`) returns the division remainder.

```js
var x = 5;
var y = 2;
var z = x % y;
> console.log(z)
1
```

In arithmetic, the division of two integers produces a **quotient** and a **remainder**.
In mathematics, the result of a **module operation** is the **remainder** of an arithmetic division.

### Incrementing

The **increment** operator (`++`) increment numbers.

```js
var x = 5;
x++;
var z = x;
> console.log(z)
6
```

### Decrementing

The **decrement** operator (`--`) decrements numbers.

```js
var x = 5;
x--;
var z = x;
> console.log(z)
4
```

### Exponentiation

The **exponentiation** operator (`**`) raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

```js
var x = 5;
var z = x ** 2;     // result is 25
```

`x ** z` produces the same result as `Math.pow(x,z)`;

```js
var x = 5;
var z = Math.pow(x,2)   // result is 25
```

### Operator Precedence

Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

```js
var x = 100 + 50 * 3; // Result is 250
> console.log(x);
250
```
Is the result of example above the same as `150 * 3`, or it it the same as `100 + 150`?

Is the addition or the multiplication done first?

As in traditional school mathematics, the multiplication is done first.

Multiplication (`*`) and division (`/`) have higher precedence than addition (`+`) and subtraction (`-`).

And (as in school mathematics) the precedence can be changed by using paretheses:

```js
var x = (100 + 50) * 3; // Result 450
> console.log(x);
450
```

When using parenthesis, the operations inside the parenthses are computed first.

When many operations have the same precedence (like addition and subtraction), they are computed from left to right:

```js
var x = 100 + 50 - 3;
> console.log(x)
147 // Result
```
