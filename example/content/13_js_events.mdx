## JS Events

HTML events are **"things"** that happen to HTML elements.

When JavaSCript is used in HTML pages, JS can **"react"** on these events.

### HTML events

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

Here are some examples of HTML events:

- An HTML web page has finished loading.
- An HTML input field was changed.
- An HTML button was cliked.

Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

HTML allows event handler attributes, **with JavaScript code**, to be added to HTML elements.

**With single quotes:**

```js
<element event='some JavaScript'>
```

**With double quotes:**

```js
<element event="some JavaScript"
```

In the following example, an `onclick` attribute (with code), is added to a `<button>` element:

Example:

```js
<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
```

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML=Date()">Hac√© click para saber que hora es</button>

<p id="demo"></p>

</body>
</html>
```

In the example above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with `id="demo"`.

In the next example, the code changes the content of it own element (using `this.innerHTML`):

Example

```js
<button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">The time is?</button>

</body>
</html>
```

JavaScript code is often several lines long. It is more common to see event attributes calling functions:

```js
<button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>
```

Example:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>Click the button to display the date.</p>

<button onclick="displayDate()">The time is?</button>

<script>
function displayDate() {
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = Date();
}
</script>

<p id="demo"></p>

</body>
</html> 
```

## Common HTML Events

Here is a list of some common HTML events:

| Event         | Description                                        |
|--------------:|:---------------------------------------------------|
| onchange      | An HTML element has been changed                   |
| onclick       | The user clicks an HTML element                    |
| onmouseover   | The user moves the mouse over an HTML element      |
| onmouseout    | The user moves the mouse away from an HTML elment  |
| onkeydown     | The user pushes a keyboard key                     |

## What can JS Do?

Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:

- Things that should be done every time a page loads
- Things that should be done when the page is closed
- Action that should be performed when a user cliks a button
- Content that should be verified when auser inputs data
- And more...

Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:

- HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
- HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
- You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
- You can prevent events from being sent or being handled
- And more...
