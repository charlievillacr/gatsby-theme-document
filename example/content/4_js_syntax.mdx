## JS Syntax

JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

```js
var x, y, z;    //How to declare variables
x = 5: y = 6;   //How to assign values
z = x + y;      //How to cmpute values
```

### JS Values

The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values: 

1. Fixed values: are called **literals**.
2. Variable values: are called **variables**

#### JS Literals

The most important rules for writing **fixed values** are:

**Numbers** are written with or without decimals:

```js
100.50
1001
```

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Numbers</h2>

<p>Number can be written with or without decimals.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 10.50;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

**Strings** are text, written within double or single quotes:

```js
"John Doe"
'John Doe'
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

<p>Strings can be written with double or single quotes.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 'John Doe';
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## JS Variables

In a programming language, **variables** are used to **store** data values.

JavaScript uses the `var` keyword to **declare** variables.

An **equal sign** is used to **assign values** to variables.

In this example, `x` is defined as variable. Then is assigned (given) the value 6:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Variables</h2>

<p>In this example, x is defined as a variable.

Then, x is assigned the value of 6:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x;
x = 6;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript uses arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to compute values:

```js
(5 + 6) * 10
```
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Operators</h2>

<p>JavaScript uses arithmetic operators to compute values (just like algebra).</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = (5 + 6) * 10;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

JavaScript uses an **assignment operator** (`=`) to **assign** values to variables:

```js
var x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;
```

## JavaScript Expressions

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.

The computation is called an evaluation.

For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50;

```js
5 * 10
```

Expressions can also contain varible values:

```js
x * 10
```

The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.

For example, `"John" + " " "Doe"`, evaluates to `"John Doe"`:

```js
"John" + " " + "Doe"
```

## JavaScript Keywords

JavaScript **keywords** are used to identify actions to be performed.

The `var` keyword tells the browser to create variables:

```js
var x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>The var Keyword Creates Variables</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = y;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

## JavaScrips Comments

Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".

Code after double slashes `//` or between `/*` and `*/` is treated as a **comment**.

Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:

```js
var x = 5;  // I will be executed
// var x = 6; I will NOT be executed
```

## JavaScript Identifiers

Identifiers are names.

In JavaScript, identifiers are used to name variables (and keywords, and functions, and labels).

The rules for legal names are much the same in most programming languages.

In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (`_`), or a dollar sign (`$`).

Numbers are not allowed as the first character.

This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.

## JavaScript is Case Sensitive

All JavaScript identifiers are **case sensitive**.

The variables `lastName` and `lastname`, are two different variables:

```js
var lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript is Case Sensitive</h2>

<p>Try change lastName to lastname.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var lastname, lastName;
lastName = "Doe";
lastname = "Peterson";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = lastName;
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

JavaScript does not interpret **VAR** or **Var** as the keyword **var**.

## JavaScript and Camel Case

Historically, programmers have used different ways of joining multiple words into one variable name:

**Hyphens**

first-class, last-name, master-card, inter-city.

Hyphens are not allowed in JavaScript. They are reserved for subtraction.

**Underscore**

first_name, last_name, master-card, inter_city.

**Upper Camel Case (Pascal Case):

FirstName, LastName, MasterCard, InnerCity.

**Lower Camel Case:**

JavaScript programmers tend to use camel case that starts with a lowercase letter:

`firstName`, `lastName`, `masterCard`, `innerCity`.

## JavaScript Character Set

JavaScript uses the **Unicode** character set.

Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
