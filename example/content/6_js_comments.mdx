## JS Comments

JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

### Single line comments

Single line comments start with `//`.

Any text between `//` and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will no be executed.)

Example:

```js
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My First paragraph.";
```

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 id="myH"></h1>
<p id="myP"></p>

<script>
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

This exaxmple uses a single-line comment before each code line.


```js
var x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
var y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
```


### Multi-line Comments

Multi-line comments start with `/*` and end with `*/`.

Any text between `/*` and `*/` will be ignored by JavaScript.

This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:

Example:

```js
/* The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 id="myH"></h1>
<p id="myP"></p>

<script>
/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "JavaScript Comments";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

It is most common to use single line comments.

Block comments are often used for formal documentation.

## Using comments to prevent execution

Using comments to prevent execution of code is suitable for code testing.

Adding `//` in front of a code line changes the code lines from an executable line to a comment.

This example uses `//` to prevent execution of one of the code lines:

```js
// document.getElementByID("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML="My first paragraph.";
```

```html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>

<h1 id="myH"></h1>

<p id="myP"></p>

<script>
//document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
</script>

<p>The line starting with // is not executed.</p>

</body>
</html>

```

This example uses a comment block to prevent execution of multiple lines:

```js
/*
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph"
*/
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>

<h1 id="myH"></h1>

<p id="myP"></p>

<script>
/*
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "Welcome to my Homepage";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "This is my first paragraph.";
*/
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "The comment-block is not executed.";
</script>


</body>
</html>

```
