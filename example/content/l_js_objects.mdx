## Real life Objects, Properties and Methods

In real life, a car is an **object**.

A car has **properties**

| Object             |  Properties              |  Methods        |
|:-------------------|:------------------------:|----------------:|
| ![Fiat](./car.png) |   `car.name = Fiat`      | `car.start()`   |
| ![Fiat](./car.png) |   `car.model = 500`      | `car.drive()`   |
| ![Fiat](./car.png) |   `car.weight = 850kg`   | `car.brake()`   |
| ![Fiat](./car.png) |   `car.color = White`    | `car.stop()`    |

All cars have the same **properties**, but the property **values** differ from car to car.

All cars have the same methods, but the methods are performed **at different times**

## JavaScript Objects

You have already learned that JavaSctipt variables are containers for data values.

This code assigns a **simple value** (Fiat) to a **variable** named car:

```js
var car = "Fiat";
```

Objects are variables too. But obects can contain many values.

This code assigns **many values** (Fiat, 500, white) to a **variable**.

```js
var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
```

The values are written as `name:value` pairs (name and value separated by a colon).

JavaScript objects are containers for **named values** called properties or methods.

## Object Definition

You define (and create) a JavaScript object with an object literal:

Example:

```js
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

Spaces and line breaks are not important. An object definition can span multiple lines:

Examples:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
// Create an object:
var person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age: 50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

// Display some data from the object:
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
person.firstName + " is " + person.age + " years old.";
</script>

</body>
</html>
```

### Object Properties

The **name.values** pairs in JavaScript objects are called **properties**.

| Property      |  Property Value   |
|--------------:|:-----------------:|
|   firstName   |   John            |
|   lastName    |   Doe             |
|   age         |   50              |
|   eyeColor    |   blue            |
